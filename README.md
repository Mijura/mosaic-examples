# Mosaic Tool Usage Example

This example project uses [`@jigjoy-io/mosaic`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jigjoy-io/mosaic) to demonstrate how to run an LLM-powered agent â€” both standalone and with an attached **tool** (a function the agent can call to interact with the outside world).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

## About

Mosaic provides a simple framework for composing AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute actions.  
In this example, youâ€™ll learn how to configure an agent, attach a tool, and observe how the LLM decides when to invoke it during a conversation.

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agents/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ meteorologist-with-tool.ts   # Example agent with a tool
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adapters/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ openai/                      # OpenAI integration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ examples/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.ts                     # Entry point for examples
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Example Output

When running the app, youâ€™ll see how the LLM responds differently depending on whether it has access to a tool â€” dynamically deciding when to call it and how to use its results.
